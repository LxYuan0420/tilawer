TIL (Today I Learned)

Naming
- `YYYY-MM-DD_til_<topic>.md`
- Use lowercase and hyphens for spaces. Example:
  - `2025-08-22_til_gpg-agent-timeout.md`

How to write
- Keep to 150â€“400 words; one idea per post.
- Start with a one-sentence takeaway, then context, steps/snippet, pitfalls, links.
- Text-only; no images. Prefer copy-pasteable commands.

Start from `_template.md` in this folder.
